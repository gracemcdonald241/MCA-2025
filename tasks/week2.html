<!-- Version 1.0 -->
\- For my first piece of jazz music, i have chose is Afternoon by Jack Shi. When i transcribed this piece i got an accurate interpretation.
When i uploaded it to audiveris, i had to compress the file down as it was too large to process. Most of the score was transcribed accurately by audiveris. however once the data was scanned and collected, 
it didnt look so accurate on musescore.\

<h2>orginal vs transcription</h2>

<p>Here are my music pieces from Week 2:</p>
