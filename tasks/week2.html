# Week 2
<!-- Version 1.0 -->
\- For my first piece of christmas music, i have chose 12 days of christmas by Fredric Austin. when i transcribed this piece i got a very inaccurate interpretation.
When i uploaded it to audiveris, i had to compress the file down as it was too large to process. Most of the score was transcribed accurately by audiveris. however once the data was scanned and collected, 
it didnt look so accurate on musescore.\
