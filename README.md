<h2>Jazz</h2>
<p>
    This portfolio follows a jazz theme. Each week explores a way in which music can be encoded and analysed. I thought jazz would be a useful theme as it covers range of timer periods and it often quite easy to find in archives online. However, throughout my portfolio i have mainly refered to the piece Afternoon Lounge by Jack Shi to maintain consistency and easily compare different curation techniques. Every page should be accesible, however you can only access week 3 from the homepage, not from other weeks.
